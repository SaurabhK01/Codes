```{r}
table(hhy_small$hhsplitid.y)
```
We can see here that there are 20 more HH which are branching further into HHSPLITID, for Final presentation we must remove them in Long HH data.


```{r}
anomaly <- hhy_small %>%
  filter(hhsplitid.y %in% c(2,3,4)) %>%
  select(code)
```

```{r}
ihds1_hh %>%
  filter(code == 31603111) %>%
  select(starts_with("ID"))
```


Checking specific data in the main file
```{r}
ihds2_hh %>%
  filter(code == 31603111)
```
There's only one observation! That does mean that 20 such rows are merely an anamoly in the dataset. Need to further check.
